positive: A film bursting at the seams with sheer, unadulterated joy: watch it, and the world seems just that little bit brighter...
negative: A film that seeks to inspire our loathing for nearly every frame it sits on the screen, and that is before we even attempt to decipher the mediocrity that is the music or the nonexistence of the story.
positive: feminist, foul-mouthed and funny, turning the formulaic tropes of bawdy comedies inside out and giving us a couple of teen heroines who feel real and very 2019.
